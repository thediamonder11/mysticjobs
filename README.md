# MysticMC Job page
The MysticMC Job application page is run on a replit page. I use replit to host the website because it is a mostly reliable service. I connected to domain using a redirect instead of linking it to replit. This is why different pages don't show different links.
# Why Replit?
I use replit to host the website because it has great connection to github. It can also be used to host multiple pages and have them running in seconds.
# Why is this a publc repository?
I have decided to make this a public repository so people can see my code. It also allows people to make forks of the website pages or report issues that would otherwise be dificult to find.
